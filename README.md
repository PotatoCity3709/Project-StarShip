# Project-StarShip
The game of space travel...
Project: StarShip is a text-based adventure game where you are the captain of the ship (Name of the players' choice). Traverse through many rooms, each with their own special actions! Can you be up to the task, of space travel?

Coding the text-based version is almost complete, all I need to do is finish the room exploration coding, some of the actions and some other little tasks to do here and there along the code.
